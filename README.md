# Street Trees of New York City


This application displays the New York City [2015 Street Tree Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh), conducted by volunteers and staff organized by NYC Parks & Recreation and partner organizations. Tree data collected includes tree species, diameter and perception of health. Accompanying blockface data is available indicating status of data collection and data release citywide.  The application allows for dynamic filtering by tree species and diameter, and additionally we calculate summary information about the biggest tree, most common type, and average size for an area of interest defined either interactively or by street address.

> Data provided by Department of Parks and Recreation (DRP) via the [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) portal.
